# Dynamic Programming
A method for solving a complex probelm by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of the subproblems just once, and storing their solutions (this reduces duplication).

An approach for solving _some_ problems.  
For those problems that can be solved with __dynamic programming__, it can make a huge difference in their performance.

2 indicators that we can use dynamic programming on a given problem:

- **overlapping subproblems**

- **optimal substructure**
