# Data Structures

Collections of values, the relationships among them, and the function or operations that can be applied to the data
ex: array 
- holds many values
- contains the relationships between those values -- the order
- come with built in methods and functionalities, (push, pop, sorting etc)

### Why are there so many?  
Different data structures excel at different things  
Some are very specialised, others are more generally used (like arrays)  

### Why are they important?
- as a developer, likely to need one of these structures  
- You've already worked with many of them unknowingly (DOM in JavaScript === tree)
- Interviews!

Each data structure excels in different situations
