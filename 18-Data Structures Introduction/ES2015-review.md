In addition to learning the data structures, we will implement them.
JS doesn't come with them prebuilt, we will write our own.
We will use ES2015 to use `class` keyword to create the data stuctures

A class is a blueprint for creating objects with predefined methods and properties

(JS is not truly OOP, it's prototyped-based-inheritance. `class` keyword is syntactic sugar.)
